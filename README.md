# GitHub French Ranking Generator

This repository contains the configuration files to generate the GitHub rankings of France.

[GitHubCity](https://github.com/iblancasa/GitHubCity) is used to generate the rankings.

## How to generate the rankings?

**IMPORTANT: GitHubCity is not compatible with Python 2. So, this repository will not work with Python 2.**

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
